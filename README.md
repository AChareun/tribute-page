# tribute-page (Antonio Gramsci)
Responsive Web Design Certification project for freeCodeCamp using pure html and css

Includes freeCodeCamp test suite CDN.

[Demo](https://achareun.github.io/tribute-page/)

## Work to do:

I intend to give this project a more funny/joke-vibe so it has a more personal style. So that's something I'll work on eventually.
